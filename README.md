# House-Price-Prediction-
*Overview : 
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices, inspired by a research paper on housing price estimation. The base algorithms used in the paper (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) are extended with additional enhancements including XGBoost, Polynomial Regression, and a Stacked Ensemble Model.

*Objective :
To develop a predictive model for house prices using supervised machine learning algorithms and to evaluate performance based on accuracy and generalization.

Tech Stack
*Programming Language: Python

*Libraries & Tools:
NumPy, Pandas
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

*Algorithms Implemented :
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Polynomial Regression
